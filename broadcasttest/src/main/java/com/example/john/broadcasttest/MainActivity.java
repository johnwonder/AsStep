     * Perform any final cleanup before an activity is destroyed.  This can
     * happen either because the activity is finishing (someone called
     * {@link #finish} on it, or because the system is temporarily destroying
     * this instance of the activity to save space.  You can distinguish
     * between these two scenarios with the {@link #isFinishing} method.
     * <p/>
     * <p><em>Note: do not count on this method being called as a place for
     * saving data! For example, if an activity is editing data in a content
     * provider, those edits should be committed in either {@link #onPause} or
     * {@link #onSaveInstanceState}, not here.</em> This method is usually implemented to
     * free resources like threads that are associated with an activity, so
     * that a destroyed activity does not leave such things around while the
     * rest of its application is still running.  There are situations where
     * the system will simply kill the activity's hosting process without
     * calling this method (or any others) in it, so it should not be used to
     * do things that are intended to remain around after the process goes
     * away.
     * <p/>
     * <p><em>Derived classes must call through to the super class's
     * implementation of this method.  If they do not, an exception will be
     * thrown.</em></p>

         * This method is called when the BroadcastReceiver is receiving an Intent
         * broadcast.  During this time you can use the other methods on
         * BroadcastReceiver to view/modify the current result values.  This method
         * is always called within the main thread of its process, unless you
         * explicitly asked for it to be scheduled on a different thread using
         * {@link Context#registerReceiver(BroadcastReceiver,
         * IntentFilter, String, Handler)}. When it runs on the main
         * thread you should
         * never perform long-running operations in it (there is a timeout of
         * 10 seconds that the system allows before considering the receiver to
         * be blocked and a candidate to be killed). You cannot launch a popup dialog
         * in your implementation of onReceive().
         * <p/>
         * <p><b>If this BroadcastReceiver was launched through a &lt;receiver&gt; tag,
         * then the object is no longer alive after returning from this
         * function.</b>  This means you should not perform any operations that
         * return a result to you asynchronously -- in particular, for interacting
         * with services, you should use
         * {@link Context#startService(Intent)} instead of
         * {@link Context#bindService(Intent, ServiceConnection, int)}.  If you wish
         * to interact with a service that is already running, you can use
         * {@link #peekService}.
         * <p/>
         * <p>The Intent filters used in {@link Context#registerReceiver}
         * and in application manifests are <em>not</em> guaranteed to be exclusive. They
         * are hints to the operating system about how to find suitable recipients. It is
         * possible for senders to force delivery to specific recipients, bypassing filter
         * resolution.  For this reason, {@link #onReceive(Context, Intent) onReceive()}
         * implementations should respond only to known actions, ignoring any unexpected
         * Intents that they may receive.
         *
         * @param context The Context in which the receiver is running.
         * @param intent  The Intent being received.
